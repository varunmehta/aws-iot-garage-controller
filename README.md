# aws-iot-garage-opener

As part of the Slalom hackathon, reviving an old local only project, and extending it to be cloud enabled. This code will now use aws-iot-core and other libraries to communicate with the server. For now it's a simple repo, will break it down to smaller sections once the lambda and other pieces of code take shape.
